# Ant-Colony-Simulation-V2.0

## Overview
An ant colony simulation where ants spawn from a colony and try to find and deposit food in a ant pheromone style. 
This is a reworked project I have worked on before called Pheromone-Simulation V1.0.

This version contains a lot more efficient structure and expandable code. The path following is more intelligent than last time and the properties for the ants are very customisable.
The ants now drop a visible trail although the ants will scense a world grid which they place the scents on for optimisation so that overlapping scents don't waste computation power.
This Project is completed to what I intended to implement which was a ant pheromone simulation 

## Ant Features:
- Exploring
- Return Home (Hunger)
  - Record path home
- Follow Scent 
- Place Scents
- Return Home (Deposit Food)

## Other Features:
- Colony (Spawn Ants)
- Food Source (Spawn Food)
- Walls (Contain Ants)
